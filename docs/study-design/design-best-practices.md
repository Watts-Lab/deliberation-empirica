# Experiment Design Best Practices

This documentation is currently a work in progress. It will cover:

- Laying out your experiment code in easy to read and replicate ways.
- Naming and tagging variables to make analysis easy
- Writing concise instructions participants will actually read.
- Including attention/engagement checks suited for live conversations.
- Using templates to ensure that you only change the right things between conditions.
