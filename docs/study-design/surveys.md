# Surveys

Deliberation Lab can pipe in canned surveys that are guaranteed to have the same presentation and scoring in each experiment. This makes it easier to compare results from one study to another, as you know they at least used the same instruments.

**This documentation is currently under development**

In the meantime, you can view the surveys and read about how they were constructed here: https://github.com/Watts-Lab/surveys
