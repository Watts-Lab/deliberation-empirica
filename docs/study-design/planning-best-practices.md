# Experiment Design Best Practices

> Status: stub. Capture lessons learned for crafting robust conversational experiments.

## Topics to Detail
- Writing concise instructions participants will actually read.
- Matching tone/reading level to the crowd platform audience.
- Accounting for recruitment biases (e.g., video-call reluctance, time zones).
- Building redundancy for tech issues (audio checks, reconnect flows).
- Including attention/engagement checks suited for live conversations.
- Running micro-pilots before scaling, tracking dropout, and iterating quickly.

Add concrete checklists, wording examples, and links to relevant manifests as they become available.
