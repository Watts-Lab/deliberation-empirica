### url Params

Arbitrary url parameters can be appended to the URL using the format:

```

There are several exceptions, which are used by mturk, prolific, or in debugging. The following have special meaning:

- `playerKey` - used by our system to allow "virtual" players for use in debugging.

- `hitId` - MTurk HIT
- `turkSubmitTo` - MTurk completion URL
