# Launching & Monitoring Batches

> Status: stub. Provide the step-by-step procedure for starting a batch and watching its progress.

## Checklist Ideas
- Final config validation (git commit hash, manifest versions, env vars).
- Opening recruitment channels and tracking inflow.
- Real-time monitors (participant queue, group formation, errors).
- Pausing/restarting batches and collecting logs.
- Post-run wrap-up (export data, archive configs, notify stakeholders).
