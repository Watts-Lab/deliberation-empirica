# Firefox WebRTC Compatibility Fixes

This document outlines the Firefox-specific improvements implemented to address call quality check failures in the Deliberation Lab platform.

## Issue Background

Firefox users were experiencing failures in the call quality check during the equipment setup phase, while the same hardware/connection worked fine in Chrome. This was due to Firefox's stricter WebRTC implementation and different handling of media permissions and connection establishment.

## Firefox-Specific Differences

### 1. Media Permission Handling
- Firefox requires more explicit constraints for getUserMedia
- Stricter permission validation and error handling
- Different error types for permission-related failures

### 2. WebRTC Connection Timing
- Firefox takes longer to establish WebRTC connections
- ICE candidate gathering is more conservative
- Network quality assessment is more strict

### 3. Daily.co Integration
- Firefox's WebRTC statistics differ from Chrome
- Call quality metrics are calculated differently
- Connection stability tests need more time

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Call Quality Test Improvements (`ConnectionsChecks.jsx`)

**Firefox-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Double timeout**: 20 seconds instead of 10 seconds for Firefox
- **Minimum 3 retries**: Ensures multiple attempts for connection establishment
- **Lenient quality assessment**: Accepts "poor" quality results in addition to "good" and "warning"
- **Extended retry delays**: 3-second delays between retries for Firefox
- **Initial stabilization delay**: 2-second wait before starting quality test
- **Network error handling**: Special handling for Firefox NetworkError exceptions

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Browser detection in debug logs
- Firefox-specific error categorization
- Detailed test result tracking

### 2. Network Connectivity Test Enhancements

**Firefox Optimizations:**
- **Minimum 2 retries**: Ensures better connection establishment
- **Pre-test delay**: 1-second wait before starting network test
- **Extended retry delays**: 2-second delays between attempts
- **Enhanced error tracking**: Detailed error name and result logging

### 3. WebSocket Connectivity Improvements

**Firefox-Specific Features:**
- **Minimum 2 retries**: Better handling of WebSocket establishment
- **Pre-test delay**: 800ms wait before starting WebSocket test
- **Extended retry delays**: 2-second delays between attempts
- **Improved error logging**: Enhanced debugging information

### 4. Media Permission Flow Enhancements (`GetPermissions.jsx`)

**Firefox Improvements:**
- **Explicit media constraints**: Specific video resolution and audio settings
- **Permission API delay**: 500ms delay to ensure API readiness
- **Firefox-specific error detection**: Special handling for NotAllowedError and AbortError
- **Enhanced error logging**: Detailed constraint and error information

**New Firefox Blocked State:**
- Dedicated UI for Firefox permission issues
- Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions
- Enhanced Tracking Protection guidance

### 5. Camera Setup Optimizations (`CameraCheck.jsx`)

**Firefox Enhancements:**
- **Camera start delay**: 1-second delay before starting camera
- **Initial setup delay**: 500ms delay before camera initialization
- **Enhanced error tracking**: Firefox-specific permission error detection
- **Improved logging**: Browser-specific debug information

## User-Facing Improvements

### 1. Updated Messaging
- Firefox-specific timeout indicators (20 seconds vs 10 seconds)
- Browser-aware retry messages
- Specialized troubleshooting instructions

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Firefox-specific troubleshooting steps
- Enhanced Tracking Protection guidance
- System-level permission instructions
- Alternative browser recommendations

### 3. Better User Experience
- Reduced false failures through extended timeouts
- More informative error messages
- Clearer resolution steps

## Technical Implementation Details

### Browser Detection
Uses the existing `useGetBrowser()` hook to detect Firefox and apply browser-specific logic.

### Timeout Strategy
- **Chrome/Edge**: Standard 10-second timeouts
- **Firefox**: Extended 20-second timeouts with progressive increases

### Retry Logic
- **Chrome/Edge**: 2 retries maximum
- **Firefox**: Minimum 3 retries with longer delays

### Error Categorization
Different error handling paths for:
- Permission-related errors
- Network connectivity issues  
- WebRTC-specific failures
- Browser compatibility problems

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Firefox Testing**: Test call quality checks specifically in Firefox on different networks
2. **Cross-browser Validation**: Ensure Chrome/Edge functionality remains unaffected
3. **Network Conditions**: Test under various network qualities (good, poor, unstable)
4. **Permission Scenarios**: Test with different permission states (denied, prompt, granted)
5. **System Settings**: Validate with different Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection settings

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track success rates by browser type
2. **User Feedback**: Monitor user reports for remaining Firefox issues
3. **Daily.co Updates**: Stay updated with Daily.co's Firefox compatibility improvements
4. **WebRTC Standards**: Monitor Firefox's WebRTC implementation changes
