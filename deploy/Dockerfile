# Production Dockerfile
# 
# This is used by "register_containter_image.yaml" GH action to
# 1. build a production container image that will
# 2. be registered on GHCR and subsequently
# 3. used by terraform to deploy the app

# Build image
# -----------
FROM ghcr.io/empiricaly/empirica:build-v1.3.2 AS builder

WORKDIR /build
# Copy only the pieces needed to build the container
COPY ../client/ client/
COPY ../server/ server/
COPY ../.empirica/ .empirica/

# install server dependencies
WORKDIR /build/server
RUN empirica npm install

# install client dependencies
WORKDIR /build/client
RUN empirica npm install

# Bundle the app
WORKDIR /build
RUN empirica bundle



# Final image
# -----------
# Already in the base image:
# - curl to install empirica and upload data
# - ca-certificates for the https connection
# - rsync for for the server build step
#
# Need to install:
# - nano to facilitate small changes on the server
# - git (for eventually syncing stuff that way)
