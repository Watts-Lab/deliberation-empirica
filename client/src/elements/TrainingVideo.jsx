/*
This component plays a video during the synchronous phase of the game, 
and so requires that participants begin and end the video at the same time.

To handle cases where a player disconnects, we start a reconnecting player
at (about) the same place in the video that they would be in had they not 
disconnected. This means that if they disconnect, they will miss some of 
the video, but it will not force the other participants to wait for them
to finish.
