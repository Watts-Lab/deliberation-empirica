If you arrive here without a player object assigned, 
it means that this was prior to the player registration screen, 
and so there are no experiments available for the player to join.

If you arrive here with a player object assigned,
it happened after the player registration (ie, you've done some work)
but prior to entering the game. (Ie, there should be no game object at this point)
