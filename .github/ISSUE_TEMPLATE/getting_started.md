Welcome to the team! This template will walk you through everything you need to do to get started contributing to the deliberation project.

# Admin

# Set up tools

We use the following tools in our development workflow to help us collaborate effectively. Even if you have your own preferred tools, such as a git client or IDE (ðŸ¤“), please make sure to set up and become familiar with the tools that we use as a team. This will allow you to assist others if they encounter problems with these tools.

- [ ] GitHub Desktop [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [ ] Docker [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) </br>
- [ ] VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [ ] VS Code extensions
  - [ ] [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - code formatter
  - [ ] [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - syntax and formatting checker

- [ ] Node https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (even though we develop in containers, we use node for running the test suite)

# Get the code

- [ ] If you're working on a Mac and using iCloud to back up your files, you may find that GitHub version control and iCloud's version control don't play well together. I would recommend creating a folder that isn't backed up to iCloud (for example at `~/github/`) for storing all your repositories.

- [ ] In this directory, use GH desktop to clone the following repository: https://github.com/Watts-Lab/deliberation-empirica.
- [ ] Create a branch of the deliberation-empirica repo, called something like `james-first-test` (but use your own name ðŸ¤”). When you make changes to the code, you'll make them in a branch, and submit a pull request to incorporate your changes into the `main` branch.



# Running the code
- [ ] In the `deliberation-empirica` directory, run `npm run build` to install the project dependencies.
- [ ] After building, run `npm run start` to start empirica

# Test

Everything we do, we test!

### End to end tests
- [ ] In the `deliberation-empirica/cypress` directory, run `npm install` to install the cypress testing dependencies.
- [ ] In the `deliberation-empirica` directory, use the command `npm run test` to launch cypress.

### Unit tests
We have some unit tests on the server code for functions that run in the background
- [ ] change to the `server` folder
- [ ] run `npm run test` to start the unit test suite

They're a bit long, but if you're already spending time on the treadmill or exercise bike (giving away my secrets here) its not too bad. 1.
