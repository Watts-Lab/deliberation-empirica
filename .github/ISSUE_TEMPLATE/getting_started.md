Welcome to the team! This template will walk you through everything you need to do to get started contributing to the deliberation project.

# Admin

- [ ] Set up a GitHub account (you should have this set up by the time you can use this template!)
- [ ] Connect with @shapeseas to:
  - [ ] Get added to [the deliberation github team](https://github.com/orgs/Watts-Lab/teams/deliberation/)
  - [ ] Get added to the deliberation slack channel
  - [ ] Complete hiring process through Workday and Onboard@Penn (if applicable)

# Set up tools

We use the following tools in our development workflow to help us collaborate effectively. Even if you have your own preferred tools, such as a git client or IDE (ðŸ¤“), please make sure to set up and become familiar with the tools that we use as a team. This will allow you to assist others if they encounter problems with these tools.

- [ ] GitHub Desktop [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [ ] Docker [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) </br>
- [ ] VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [ ] VS Code extensions
  - [ ] [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - code formatter
  - [ ] [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - syntax and formatting checker
  - [ ] [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) - containter tools
  - [ ] [YAML formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - syntax highlighting
  - [ ] [WindiCSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=voorjaar.windicss-intellisense) - syntax highlighting
- [ ] Node https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (even though we develop in containers, we use node for running the test suite)

# Get the code

- [ ] I'd recommend setting up a folder called `deliberation` somewhere on your computer where you can keep all of the files and repositories associated with this project.
- [ ] In this directory, use GH desktop to clone the following repository: https://github.com/Watts-Lab/deliberation-empirica (If you are using git at the teminal, be sure to do a recursive clone, this repository has a submodule.) There are more repos you may work with down the road, but we can get to them later.
- [ ] In the created `deliberation-empirica` directory, run `npm init` to install the testing dependencies.
- [ ] Use GitHub Desktop to create a branch of the deliberation-empirica repo, called something like `james-first-test` (but use your own name ðŸ¤”). When you make changes to the code, you'll make them in a branch, and submit a pull request to incorporate your changes into the `main` branch.

# Test

Everything we do, we test!

- [ ] Start the deliberation-empirica dev container. In the `deliberation-empirica` directory, use the command `npm run start`.
- [ ] Manually open the admin interface and start a game
- [ ] Run the cypress test suite `npm run test`
  - [ ] run each of the tests

# Resources

The following describe the deliberation project:

- (James) Here are two videos I used when I was learning docker. They're a bit long, but if you're already spending time on the treadmill or exercise bike (giving away my secrets here) its not too bad. 1.
