- The user doesn't select any/the correct label to debug their equipment. Ie, there is a problem with the audio, but the user selects a video problem by mistake. Can we still try and fix the audio?
- If we can't reacquire the desired device (e.g., the user selects that they want headphones in the setup, but then headphones disappear), should we prompt the user for the device they do want to use? Or should we give them an option to select a new device from those that are available? Just falling back to another device is kinda confusing, because the user would still be expecting sound to come from their headphones, but it's actually coming out somewhere else, so they may not be able to tell if the problem is that their audio is coming from another source, or if it's a problem with the experiment platform, or their partner, etc.
- If a participant clicks "Fix A/V", I think we already capture logging from their alters - should we also try a soft-fix?
- Do we raise a sentry report every time that a user has to click the "FixA/V" button? Would be good to get a sense for the frequency and causes of this as a whole...
- Does the "Fix A/V" button count as a user gesture, and allow us to do all the repairs we need?
- Does a modal pop up prompting for a user gesture when we detect (outside the fix A/V workflow) that we need a gesture to correct the state, etc?
