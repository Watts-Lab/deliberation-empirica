The synchronous portion of the study can include one or more
discussion stages using video, audio-only, or text chat.

All types of discussion are managed within the platform.

For video and audio discussions, we collect separate tracks
for each participant, making it straightforward to attribute
utterances to speakers, and account for speaking time,
interruptions, overspeak, etc.
