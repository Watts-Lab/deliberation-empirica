```
We can display a variety of elements on each page:

- videos
- timers (example in this stage)
- audio files
- raw images
- answers to previous prompts
- sortable lists
- qualtrics surveys
- shared notepads (like google docs)
- talk time meters

We can also implement other widgets as needed as
simple react components.
