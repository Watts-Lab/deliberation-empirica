Game sequence

1. The study starts with an individual (asynchronous) intro phase.
   The first part of this phase includes effort checks and webcam setup.
   The second part includes surveys and prompts to measure participant attributes.
   You are currently in this second part.
2. Participants are then randomized into different conditions.
3. Next, they enter the synchronous phase, moving through a series of stages with other participants.
4. Finally, participants complete asynchronous exit stages.
