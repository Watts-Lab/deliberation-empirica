# Scroll Indicator Test Materials

This directory contains test materials for the scroll indicator feature.

When new content appears below the viewport (e.g., timed conditional elements),
the scroll awareness feature either:
- Auto-scrolls with a gentle "peek" if user is near the bottom
- Shows a floating indicator if user is not at the bottom
