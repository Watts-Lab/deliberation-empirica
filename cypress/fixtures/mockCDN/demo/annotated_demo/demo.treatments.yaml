# This file implements an annotated demo experiment that illustrates
# various features of the platform, including conditional assignment,
# video chat, and surveys.

# This demo contains most, but not all of the features of the full
# platform.

templates:
  # Templates are used to create reusable pieces of structure.
  # They are defined here, and then instantiated in the introSequences and treatments
  # sections below. This allows us to create multiple similar intro sequences and
  # treatments that differ only in small ways - here, the topic of discussion.

  - templateName: topicPrompt
    contentType: element # templates can replace structure at any level - element, treatment, introStep, etc. and lists of these
    templateContent: # here we implement a prompt that we will reuse below
      type: prompt
      name: ${topicName}_presurvey # templates can take fields that are substituted in the templateContent
      file: demo/annotated_demo/topics/${topicName}_survey.md # fields use the syntax ${fieldName}

  - templateName: crossPartisanDiscussion
    contentType: treatment # it is quite common for a template to include the whole treatment structure, so that small changes can be made between conditions
    templateDesc: for measuring the effect of topic on cross-party discussion outcomes
    templateContent:
      name: ${treatmentName}
      playerCount: 2 # the number of participants in a particular group must always be specified
      groupComposition: # you can optionally describe the features that participants must have in order to be assigned to a slot
        - position: 0 # each slot in the game has an assigned position, starting from 0
          title: "Democrat" # you can optionally give each position a title that you can choose to display to participants
          conditions:
            - reference: survey.partyAffiliation.result.normPosition # conditions can be based on survey results from the intro sequence, or URL params, and a few other sources. See: https://deliberation-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conditions/
              comparator: isBelow # there are a number of comparators available - see the documentation
              value: 0.5 # currently, value must be prespecified - you cannot use another reference as the value (that's in development)

        - position: 1 # there must be the same number of positions as playerCount
          title: "Republican"
          conditions:

          elements: # the elements displayed during each stage are listed from top to bottom.
            - type: prompt # one type of element is a prompt, which displays text from a markdown file, and sometimes response options
              file: demo/annotated_demo/game/describeConditionalAssignment.md # files are relative to the root path of the repository (for now), and can be organized however you like. In practice, it is helpful to organize by where the file is first used, e.g. intro, game, exit, and then separate folders for any stimuli that are used in multiple sections.
