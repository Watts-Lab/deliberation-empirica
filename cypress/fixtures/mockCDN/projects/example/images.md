# Adding Images to a Markdown File

Let's try adding an image to this markdown file using the following syntaxs:

- `![Alt Text](url)` (web based image)

- `![My Image](image.jpg)` (same directory as md file)

- `![My Image](/path/to/image.jpg)` (general format)

- `![My Image](../relative/path/to/image.jpg)` (relative directory, `..` to move up the file tree)

If you look in the file `images.md` you will see the examples above in use.
