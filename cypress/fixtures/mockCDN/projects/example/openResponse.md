# Markdown or HTML?

We need to decide whether to use Markdown or HTML for storing
[deliberation](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.081306.070308) topics.

- **Markdown** files are a convenient way to include basic formatting in a human-readable plain text document that can be easily version controlled.
- **HTML** documents allow for more customization, but are more difficult to write and to read without a renderer.

_Are there any other reasons you can think of for choosing one or the other?_
