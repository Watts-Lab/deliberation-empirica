# Character Counter Demonstration

This prompt demonstrates the new character counter functionality. Please write a response that is between 100 and 500 characters long.

You should see a character counter in the lower right corner that shows your progress like this: "(current / 100-500 chars)".

**Requirements:**
- Minimum: 100 characters
- Maximum: 500 characters
- Counter updates in real-time as you type
