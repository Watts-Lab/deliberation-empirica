// This test checks that the experiment loads even if there is no playerKey
// This will be the default behavior for most users, but we have a hard time
// testing it in cypress, because we need unique player keys so that empirica
// doesn't treat every test case as the same returning user, and preserve their
// state. So, this test just checks that the informed consent form renders,
// as this checks that the naked url is displaying the EmpiricaPlayer object
// corrrectly, and leaves the rest of the testing to the other tests.
